# CSS Layout

As a front-end engineer, I deal with a lot of layouts and components. While there are plenty of CSS frameworks out there that provide these, I don't always want to include them all in my project.

That's why I've put together a collection of the most popular layouts and components that can be built with pure CSS.

These layouts and components are powered by modern CSS features like flexbox and grid, and can be easily customized to fit your specific needs. By combining them, you can create any possible layout you need.

The best part? This collection has zero dependencies, no frameworks, and no CSS hacks. These are real use cases that can save you time and effort in your projects.
